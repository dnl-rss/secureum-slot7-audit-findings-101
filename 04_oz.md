# Open Zeppelin Audit Findings
___
## UMA Phase 4 Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-audit-phase-4/)

### 77. UMA Phase 4

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Lack of event emission after sensitive actions

**Description**: The `_getLatestFundingRate` function of the `FundingRateApplier` contract does not `emit` relevant events after executing the sensitive actions of setting the `fundingRate`, `updateTime`, and `proposalTime`, and transferring the rewards.

**Recommendation**: Consider emitting events after sensitive changes take place, to facilitate tracking and notify off-chain clients following the contract’s activity.


### 78. UMA Phase 4

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Functions with unexpected side-effects

**Description**: Some functions have side-effects. For example, the `_getLatestFundingRate` function of the `FundingRateApplier` contract might also update the funding rate and send rewards. The `getPrice` function of the `OptimisticOracle` contract might also settle a price request. These side-effect actions are not clear in the name of the functions and are thus unexpected, which could lead to mistakes when the code is modified by new developers not experienced in all the implementation details of the project.

**Recommendation**: Consider splitting these functions in separate getters and setters. Alternatively, consider renaming the functions to describe all the actions that they perform.

##  1inch Liquidity Protocol Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/1inch-liquidity-protocol-audit/)

### 79. 1inch Liquidity Protocol

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Mooniswap pairs cannot be unpaused

**Description**: The `MooniswapFactoryGovernance` contract has a shutdown function that can be used to pause the contract and prevent any future swaps. However there is no function to unpause the contract. There is also no way for the factory contract to redeploy a `Mooniswap` instance for a given pair of tokens. Therefore, if a `Mooniswap` contract is ever shutdown/paused, it will not be possible for that pair of tokens to ever be traded on the Mooniswap platform again, unless a new factory contract is deployed.

**Recommendation**: Consider providing a way for `Mooniswap` contracts to be unpaused.


## Futureswap V2 Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/futureswap-v2-audit/)

### 80. Futureswap V2

<span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>

**Finding**: Attackers can prevent honest users from performing an instant withdraw from the `Wallet` contract

**Description**: An attacker who sees an honest user’s call to `MessageProcessor.instantWithdraw` in the mempool can grab the `oracleMessage` and `oracleSignature` parameters from the user’s transaction, then submit their own transaction to `instantWithdraw` using the same parameters, a higher gas price (so as to frontrun the honest user’s transaction), and carefully choosing the gas limit for their transactions such that the internal call to the `callInstantWithdraw` will fail on line 785 with an out-of-gas error, but will successfully execute the `if(!success)` block. The result is that the attacker’s instant withdraw will fail (so the user will not receive their funds), but the `userInteractionNumber` will be successfully reserved by the `ReplayTracker`. As a result, the honest user’s transaction will revert because it will be attempting to use a `userInteractionNumber` that is no longer valid.

**Recommendation**: Consider adding an access control mechanism to restrict who can submit `oracleMessages` on behalf of the user.


### 81. Futureswap V2

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Not using upgrade safe contracts in `FsToken` inheritance

**Description**: The `FsToken` contract is intended to be an upgradeable contract, used behind a proxy (namely, the `FsTokenProxy` contract). However, the contracts `ERC20Snapshot`, `ERC20Mintable`, and `ERC20Burnable` in the inheritance chain of `FsToken` are not imported from the upgrade safe library `@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package` but instead from `@openzeppelin/contracts`.

**Recommendation**: Use the upgrades safe library in this case will ensure the inheritance from Initializable and the other contracts is always linearized as expected by the compiler.


### 82. Futureswap V2

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Unchecked output of the ECDSA recover function:

**Description**: The `ECDSA.recover` function (in version 2.5.1) returns `address(0)` if the signature provided is invalid. This function is used twice in the `Futureswap` code: Once to recover an `oracleAddress` from an `oracleSignature`, and again to recover the user’s address from their signature. If the oracle signature was invalid, the `oracleAddress` is set to `address(0)`. Similarly, if the user’s signature is invalid, then the `userMessage.signer` or the `withDrawer` is set to `address(0)`. This can result in unintended behavior.

**Recommendation**: Consider reverting if the output of the `ECDSA.recover` is ever `address(0)`

___
## Notional Protocol Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/notional-audit/)

### 83. Notional Protocol

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Adding new variables to multi-level inherited upgradeable contracts may break `storage` layout

**Description**: The Notional protocol uses the `OpenZeppelin/SDK` contracts to manage upgradeability in the system, which follows the unstructured storage pattern. When using this upgradeability approach, and when working with multi-level inheritance, if a new variable is introduced in a parent contract, that addition can potentially overwrite the beginning of the storage layout of the child contract, causing critical misbehaviors in the system.

**Recommendation**: consider preventing these scenarios by defining a `storage` gap in each upgradeable parent contract at the end of all the storage variable definitions as follows: `uint256[50] __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions`. In such an implementation, the size of the gap would be intentionally decreased each time a new variable was introduced, thereby avoiding overwriting preexisting storage values.

___
## GEB Protocol Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/geb-protocol-audit/)

### 84. GEB Protocol

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Unsafe division in `rdivide` and `wdivide` functions

**Description**: The function `rdivide` on line 227 and the function `wdivide` on line 230 of the `GlobalSettlement` contract, accept the divisor `y` as an input parameter. However, these functions do not check if the value of `y` is `0`. If that is the case, the call will revert due to the division by zero error.

**Recommendation**: consider adding a `require` statement in the functions to ensure `y > 0`, or consider using the `div` functions provided in OpenZeppelin’s `SafeMath` libraries

___
## 1inch Exchange Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/1inch-exchange-audit/)

### 85. 1inch

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Incorrect `safeApprove` usage

**Description**: The `safeApprove` function of the OpenZeppelin `SafeERC20` library prevents changing an allowance between non-zero values to mitigate a possible front-running attack. Instead, the `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `safeDecreaseAllowance` functions should be used. However, the `UniERC20` library simply bypasses this restriction by first setting the allowance to zero. This reintroduces the front-running attack and undermines the value of the `safeApprove` function. Consider introducing an `increaseAllowance` function to handle this case.

**Recommendation**: `safeIncreaseAllowance` and `safeDecreaseAllowance` functions should be used

___
## Opyn Gamma Protocol Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/opyn-gamma-protocol-audit/)

### 86. Opyn Gamma Protocol

<span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>

**Finding**: ETH could get trapped in the protocol

**Description**: The `Controller` contract allows users to send arbitrary actions such as possible flash loans through the `_call` internal function. Among other features, it allows sending ETH with the action to then perform a call to a `CalleeInterface` type of contract. To do so, it saves the original `msg.value` sent with the operate function call in the `ethLeft` variable and it updates the remaining ETH left after each one of those calls to revert in case that it is not enough. Nevertheless, if the user sends more than the necessary ETH for the batch of actions, the remaining ETH (stored in the `ethLeft` variable after the last iteration) will not be returned to the user and will be locked in the contract due to the lack of a `withdrawEth` function.

**Recommendation**: Consider either returning all the remaining ETH to the user or creating a function that allows the user to collect the remaining ETH after performing a Call action type, taking into account that sending ETH with a push method may trigger the `fallback` function on the caller’s address.


### 87. Opyn Gamma Protocol

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Use of `transfer` might render ETH impossible to withdraw

**Description**: When withdrawing ETH deposits, the `PayableProxyController` contract uses Solidity’s `transfer` function. This has some notable shortcomings when the withdrawer is a smart contract, which can render ETH deposits impossible to withdraw. Specifically, the withdrawal will inevitably fail when:
1. The withdrawer smart contract does not implement a `payable` fallback function.
2. The withdrawer smart contract implements a `payable` fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units.
3. The withdrawer smart contract implements a `payable` fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the call’s gas usage above 2300

**Recommendation**:  `sendValue` function available in OpenZeppelin Contract’s `Address` library can be used to transfer the withdrawn Ether without being limited to 2300 gas units. Risks of reentrancy stemming from the use of this function can be mitigated by tightly following the “Check-effects-interactions” pattern and using OpenZeppelin Contract’s `ReentrancyGuard` contract.

___
## Endaoment Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/endaoment-audit/)

### 88. Endaoment

<span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>

**Finding**: Not following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern

**Description**: The `finalizeGrant` function of the `Fund` contract is setting the `grant.complete` storage variable after a token transfer. Solidity recommends the usage of the Check-Effects-Interaction Pattern to avoid potential security issues, such as reentrancy. The `finalizeGrant` function can be used to conduct a reentrancy attack, where the token transfer in line 129 can call back again the same function, sending to the admin multiple times an amount of fee, before setting the grant as completed. In this way the `grant.recipient` can receive less than expected and the contract funds can be drained unexpectedly leading to an unwanted loss of funds.

**Recommendation**: Consider always following the “Check-Effects-Interactions” pattern, thus modifying the contract’s state before making any external call to other contracts.

___
## Audius Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/audius-contracts-audit/#high)

### 89. Audius

<span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>

**Finding**: Updating the `Governance` registry and `Guardian` addresses emits no events

**Description**: In the `Governance` contract the `registryAddress` and the `guardianAddress` are highly sensitive accounts. The first one holds the contracts that can be proposal targets, and the second one is a superuser account that can execute proposals without voting. These variables can be updated by calling `setRegistryAddress` and `transferGuardianship`, respectively. Note that these two functions update these sensitive addresses without logging any events. Stakers who monitor the Audius system would have to inspect all transactions to notice that one address they trust is replaced with an untrusted one.

**Recommendation**: Consider emitting events when these addresses are updated. This will be more transparent, and it will make it easier for clients to subscribe to the events when they want to keep track of the status of the system.


### 90. Audius

<span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>

**Finding**: The quorum requirement can be trivially bypassed with sybil accounts

**Description**: While the final vote on a proposal is determined via a token-weighted vote, the quorum check in the `evaluateProposalOutcome` function can be trivially bypassed by splitting one’s tokens over multiple accounts and voting with each of the accounts. Each of these sybil votes increases the `proposals[_proposalId].numVotes` variable. This means anyone can make the quorum check pass.

**Recommendation**: Consider measuring quorum size by the percentage of existing tokens that have voted, rather than the number of unique accounts that have voted.


### 91. Audius

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Inconsistently checking initialization

**Description**: When a contract is initialized, its `isInitialized` state variable is set to `true`. Since interacting with uninitialized contracts would cause problems, the `_requireIsInitialized` function is available to make this check. However, this check is not used consistently. For example, it is used in the `getVotingQuorum` function of the `Governance` contract, but it is not used in the `getRegistryAddress` function of the same contract. There is no obvious difference between the functions to explain this difference, and it could be misleading and cause uninitialized contracts to be called.

**Recommendation**: Consider calling `_requireIsInitialized` consistently in all the functions of the `InitializableV2` contracts. If there is a reason to not call it in some functions, consider documenting it. Alternatively, consider removing this check altogether and preparing a good deployment script that will ensure that all contracts are initialized in the same transaction that they are deployed. In this alternative, it would be required to check that contracts resulting from new proposals are also initialized before they are put in production.


### 92. Audius

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Voting period and quorum can be set to zero

**Description**: When the `Governance` contract is initialized, the values of `votingPeriod` and `votingQuorum` are checked to make sure that they are greater than `0`. However, the corresponding setter functions `setVotingPeriod` and `setVotingQuorum` allow these variables to be reset to `0`. Setting the `votingPeriod` to zero would cause spurious proposals that cannot be voted. Setting the quorum to zero is worse because it would allow proposals with `0` votes to be executed.

**Recommendation**: Consider adding the validation to the setter functions


### 93. Audius

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Some state variables are not set during `initialize`

**Description**: The `Audius` contracts can be upgraded using the unstructured storage proxy pattern. This pattern requires the use of an `initializer` instead of the `constructor` to set the initial values of the state variables. In some of the contracts, the `initializer` is not initializing all of the state variables.

**Recommendation**: Consider setting all the required variables in the `initializer`. If there is a reason for leaving them uninitialized, consider documenting it, and adding checks on the functions that use those variables to ensure that they are not called before initialization.

___
## Primitive Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/primitive-audit/)

### 94. Primitive

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Expired and/or paused options can still be traded

**Description**: Option tokens can still be freely transferred when the `Option` contract is either paused or expired (or both). This would allow malicious option holders to sell paused / expired options that cannot be exercised in the open market to exchanges and users who do not take the necessary precautions before buying an option minted by the Primitive protocol.

**Recommendation**: Should this be the system’s expected behavior, consider clearly documenting it in user-friendly documentation so as to raise awareness in option sellers and buyers. Alternatively, if the described behavior is not intended, consider implementing the necessary logic in the Option contract to prevent transfers of tokens during pause and after expiration.

___
## ACO Protocol Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/aco-protocol-audit/)

### 95. ACO Protocol

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: ERC20 transfers can misbehave

**Description**: The `_transferFromERC20` function is used throughout `ACOToken.sol` to handle transferring funds into the contract from a user. It is called within `mint`, within `mintTo`, and within `_validateAndBurn`. In each case, the destination is the `ACOToken` contract. Such transfers may behave unexpectedly if the token contract charges fees. As an example, the popular USDT token does not presently charge any fees upon transfer, but it has the potential to do so. In this case the amount received would be less than the amount sent. Such tokens have the potential to lead to protocol insolvency when they are used to mint new ACOTokens. In the case of `_transferERC20`, similar issues can occur, and could cause users to receive less than expected when collateral is transferred or when exercise assets are transferred.

**Recommendation**: Consider thoroughly vetting each token used within an ACO options pair, ensuring that failing `transferFrom` and `transfer` calls will cause reverts within `ACOToken.sol`. Additionally, consider implementing some sort of sanity check which enforces that the balance of the ACOToken contract increases by the desired amount when calling `_transferFromERC20`.

___
## Compound Open Price Feed – Uniswap Integration Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-open-price-feed-uniswap-integration-audit/)

### 96. Compound Open Price Feed – Uniswap Integration

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Incorrect event emission

**Description**: The `UniswapWindowUpdate` event of the `UniswapAnchoredView` contract is currently being emitted in the `pokeWindowValues` function using incorrect values. In particular, as it is being emitted before relevant state changes are applied to the `oldObservation` and `newObservation` variables, the data logged by the event will be outdated.

**Recommendation**: Consider emitting the `UniswapWindowUpdate` event after changes are applied so that all logged data is up-to-date.

___
##  MCDEX Mai Protocol Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/mcdex-mai-protocol-audit/)

### 97. MCDEX Mai Protocol

<span style="color:black; background-color:red">Critical</span>

**Finding**: Anyone can liquidate on behalf of another account

**Description**: The `Perpetual` contract has a public `liquidateFrom` function that bypasses the checks in the `liquidate` function. This means that it can be called to liquidate a position when the contract is in the `SETTLED` state. Additionally, any user can set an arbitrary `from` address, causing a third-party user to confiscate the under-collateralized trader’s position. This means that any trader can unilaterally rearrange another account’s position. They could also liquidate on behalf of the Perpetual Proxy, which could break some of the Automated Market Maker invariants, such as the condition that it only holds `LONG` positions.

**Recommendation**: Consider restricting `liquidateFrom` to `internal` visibility


### 98. MCDEX Mai Protocol

**Finding**: Orders cannot be cancelled

**Description**: When a user or broker calls `cancelOrder`, the `cancelled` mapping is updated, but this has no subsequent effects. In particular, `validateOrderParam` does not check if the order has been cancelled.

**Recommendation**: Consider adding this check to the order validation to ensure cancelled orders cannot be filled.

<span style="color:black; background-color:red">Critical</span>

### 99. MCDEX Mai Protocol

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Re-entrancy possibilities

**Description**: There are several examples of interactions preceding effects:
1. In the `deposit` function of the `Collateral` contract, collateral is retrieved before the user balance is updated and an event is emitted.
2. In the `_withdraw` function of the `Collateral` contract, collateral is sent before the event is emitted
3. The same pattern occurs in the `depositToInsuranceFund`, `depositEtherToInsuranceFund`, and `withdrawFromInsuranceFund` functions of the `Perpetual` contract.
It should be noted that even when a correctly implemented ERC20 contract is used for collateral, incoming and outgoing transfers could execute arbitrary code if the contract is also ERC777 compliant. These re-entrancy opportunities are unlikely to corrupt the internal state of the system, but they would affect the order and contents of emitted events, which could confuse external clients about the state of the system.

**Recommendation**: Consider always following the “Check-Effects-Interactions” pattern or use `ReentrancyGuard` contract is now used to protect those functions


### 100. MCDEX Mai Protocol

<span style="color:black; background-color:yellow">Medium</span>

**Finding**: Governance parameter changes should not be instant

**Description**: Many sensitive changes can be made by any account with the `WhitelistAdmin` role via the functions `setGovernanceParameter` within the `AMMGovernance` and `PerpetualGovernance` contracts. For example, the `WhitelistAdmin` can change the fee schedule, the initial and maintenance margin rates, or the lot size parameters, and these new parameters instantly take effect in the protocol with important effects. For example, raising the maintenance margin rate could cause `isSafe` to return `false` when it would have previously returned `true`. This would allow the user’s position to be liquidated. By changing `tradingLotSize`, trades may revert when being matched, where they would not have before the change. These are only examples; the complexity of the protocol, combined with unpredictable market conditions and user actions means that many other negative effects likely exist as well.

**Recommendation**: Since these changes are occasionally needed, but can create risk for the users of the protocol, consider implementing a time-lock mechanism for such changes to take place. By having a delay between the signal of intent and the actual change, users will have time to remove their funds or close trades that would otherwise be at risk if the change happened instantly.

___
## UMA Phase 1 Audit

[Report](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-audit-phase-1/)

### 101. UMA Phase 1

<span style="color:black; background-color:orange">High</span>

**Finding**: Votes can be duplicated

**Description**: The Data Verification Mechanism uses a commit-reveal scheme to hide votes during the voting period. The intention is to prevent voters from simply voting with the majority. However, the current design allows voters to blindly copy each other’s submissions, which undermines this goal. In particular, each commitment is a masked hash of the claimed price, but is not cryptographically tied to the voter. This means that anyone can copy the commitment of a target voter (for instance, someone with a large balance) and submit it as their own. When the target voter reveals their `salt` and `price`, the copycat can “reveal” the same values. Moreover, if another voter recognizes this has occurred during the commitment phase, they can also change their commitment to the same value, which may become an alternate Schelling point.

**Recommendation**: Consider including the voter address within the commitment to prevent votes from being duplicated. Additionally, as a matter of good practice, consider including the relevant timestamp, price identifier and round ID as well to limit the applicability (and reusability) of a commitment.
